# AraMDM

AraMDM is a friendlier frontend for [MicroMDM](https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm) which aims to provide a clean web UI, native management clients, persistence, and all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a modern MDM server. As such a task is enormous, the project hasn't quite achieved this goal just yet however development is ongoing.
